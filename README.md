JSF2/MongoDB web project for online newspapers and magazines
project is fully working, I pushed also db dump, it is based on JSF2/Primefaces/MongoDB+Twitter bootstrap with full Admin Tool.

You can easy extend, customize fot you, you can see MongoDB+Java full backend and frontend, it is my own cms.

Front end pages get updated only when you add new article, full done login/registration, all managable from Admin Tool.

This is can base for your own start -up.

Best Regards,
